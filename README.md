  Hey! My name is Rian Mateus and I'm a full stack developer, with no professional experience yet. I have always been interested in technology and decided to specialize in front and back end development. Since then, I've dedicated my free time to learning and improving myself in the different technologies involved in web application development.
   Currently, I'm looking for my first opportunity in the job market as a developer. I believe I have the necessary skills and dedication to become a successful professional in this field, and I look forward to putting my knowledge into practice in a real work environment. Willing to learn and grow professionally and always looking for new learning and development opportunities. If you are looking for a dedicated full stack developer willing to do whatever it takes to become a successful professional, I would appreciate the opportunity to apply for a position at your company.
